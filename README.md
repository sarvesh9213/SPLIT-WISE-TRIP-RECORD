🌍 TripSplit – Redefining Group Travel
❓ The Problem

Planning a trip with friends or family sounds exciting — until the details pile up. Someone has to manage the itinerary, someone else has to keep track of who owes money, and in the end, you’re switching between different apps (Google Docs, WhatsApp, Splitwise, spreadsheets, etc.). This creates confusion, arguments, and wasted time.

Existing apps either:

Only help in planning itineraries (like Google Trips, Wanderlog), or

Only handle expense splitting (like Splitwise).

But no platform in the world has ever combined these two — trip planning + expense management together in one single ecosystem.

💡 Our Solution – TripSplit

We built TripSplit to solve this exact problem. TripSplit is a one-of-a-kind travel companion app where you can:

Plan your trip (day-by-day itineraries, flights, hotels, activities).

Split expenses in real-time with all participants.

Track balances transparently and even send payment requests.

Collaborate with your group — everything is shared, editable, and simple.

With TripSplit, your trip is not just planned — it’s organized, fair, and stress-free.

⚙️ How It Works

Signup & Participants: Each user signs in with their email. Trips are created and participants are added. Their emails are linked automatically from our database.

Itinerary Planning:

Add flights, hotel check-ins, activities, and more.

Each activity is editable — details like time, notes, or changes can be added easily.

A delete option exists for everything (flight, arrival, hotel check-in, activities).

Add multiple days using the “Add Day” button. Each day creates its own structured itinerary.

Expense Splitting:

Add expenses during or after the trip (e.g., hotel ₹10,000 split between 4 people).

Balances are updated automatically for everyone.

Currency is flexible — users can select INR, USD, EUR, etc., and all balances reflect the chosen currency.

You can send payment requests to participants directly via email (e.g., request to Saurav Kumar goes directly to his registered email).

Transparency: Every participant sees:

Their total owed

Their total paid

Their balance remaining.

🎯 Why We Made It

We (Sarvesh Pandey & Saurav Kumar) have personally faced this problem during trips with friends. We always had:

One WhatsApp group for discussions

One Excel sheet or Google Doc for budget

Splitwise app for money tracking

Random notes for itineraries

This was messy, inefficient, and frustrating. That’s when we asked:

👉 Why hasn’t anyone combined trip planning and expense splitting into one?

That question became TripSplit.

🚀 Why TripSplit is Unique

First in the World: No existing platform unites trip planning with group expense management in one place.

Built for Real Travelers: Every feature comes from real pain points we faced ourselves.

Simple but Powerful: The app is easy for casual travelers but powerful enough for detailed planners.

TripSplit isn’t just another travel app. It’s the world’s first truly collaborative trip planner + Splitwise alternative combined.

🏆 Impact

TripSplit makes group travel:

Simpler – one app for everything.

Fairer – no confusion about money.

More fun – focus on experiences, not arguments.

Whether you’re planning a weekend getaway or a month-long international trip, TripSplit ensures everyone stays on the same page — literally.

✨ In short: TripSplit is the future of group travel. Plan smart, split fair, and travel stress-free — all in one app.
